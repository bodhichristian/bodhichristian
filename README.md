### Christian Lavelle 🆑

<b>Welcome.</b>


As an iPad user curious about Swift Playgrounds, my iOS development journey began in 2020. In 2022, I became interested in learning to develop apps, and worked through #100DaysofSwiftUI via hackingwithswift.com, earning a certificate of merit upon completion. In 2023 I'm looking to continue building the toolbelt necessary to be competitve for a junior iOS developer role.
