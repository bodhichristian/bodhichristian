* [Stubs](https://github.com/bodhichristian/Stubs) uses SwiftUI and SwiftData to store digital stubs for concerts you've attended. It serves as a playground for updated iOS 17 features.
* Users may view their concert stubs on a map with MapKit updates for SwiftUI, or query for YouTube with a concert's details.
