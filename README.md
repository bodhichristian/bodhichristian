### Christian Lavelle 🆑

<b>Welcome.</b>


As an iPad user curious about programming for Apple systems, my development journey began in 2020 with Swift Playgrounds. My hobby became passion, and I soon became interested in learning to develop full feature apps. After completing #100DaysofSwiftUI via hackingwithswift.com, I've begun certifying my iOS Development skills via Coursera. To supplement my formal learning, I practice building apps that challenge the skills I've built so far, and post my progress here.

Feel free to say hi 👋🏼
