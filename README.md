### Christian Lavelle 🆑

<b>Welcome.</b>


As an iPad user curious about programming for Apple systems, my development journey began in 2020 with Swift Playgrounds. In 2022, I became interested in learning to develop full feature apps, and worked through #100DaysofSwiftUI via hackingwithswift.com. Currently, I'm working towards a professional certification in iOS development, and building apps that challenge the skills I've learned so far.
